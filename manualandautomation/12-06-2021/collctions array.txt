Array concepts
Collections 

Array

int i=10;
int j=20;
int k=30;

Array a[]={10,20,30};//static way


//storing the array in the form of objects
//declaring an array
//size of array
//iteration in the form of index wise
int a[]=new int[3];

single dimensional array
int i=10;
int j=20;
int k=30;
int a[]=new int[3];
multi dimensionalarray

int multidim[][]=new multidim[2][2];
[100,200]
[300,400]

Arraylist

we are storing the elements in the form of dynamic array
duplicate elements will be allowed
it maintains insertion order
iteration will be in the form of index wise
Random access 

Differences between arraylist and linked list

Searching 

Arraylist will be faster compare to linkedlist

Insertion


al is slower compare to linked list

Deletions

Al is slow compare to linked list

Memory

Array list occupies less space in memory

execution

al will be faster compare to linkedlist
